//! ### Pitch Classes
//! 
//! Every pitch class has a natural reprsentation and depending on the scale, may have either a
//! sharp or flat representation and in some cases, both. The following table shows the 
//! assigned value for the natural pitch classes:
//! 
//! C = 0
//! D = 2
//! E = 4
//! F = 5
//! G = 7
//! A = 9
//! B = 11
//! 
//! If there is 'space' between two natural pitch classes than each class will have a sharp and
//! flat representation, respectively. For example, the pitches C# and Db are enharmonic;
//! C# is a semitone above `C` while Db is a half-step below its natural counterpart. 
//! 
//! Using this logic allows for 17 unique pitches to represent 12 different tones.
//! The definition above allows for 17 unique pitches to represent 12 different tones.
